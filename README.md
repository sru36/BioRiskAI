# BioRiskAI
**Deep Space Health Risk Predictor**

> Estimate astronaut DNA damage risk based on radiation, microgravity, circadian disruption, and biomarker data.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview
**BioRiskAI** is a responsive React + Tailwind frontend (with example backend integration) built for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**.  
It collects spaceflight stressor inputs, calls a prediction API, and visualizes the predicted DNA-damage risk and feature contributions (SHAP-style).
